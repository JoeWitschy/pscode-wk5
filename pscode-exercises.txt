// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

(sum=a+b)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Read N, If N%==0, Print Even, If N%2==1, Print Odd)

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a: (input n1, n2, n3, n4, n5)
b: (avg = (n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)/5)
c: (small = n1, large = n5)
d: Step b finds the sum of all 5 numbers and then divides the total by 5. Step c indicates that the smallest number in the set is 1 and the largest is 5.
